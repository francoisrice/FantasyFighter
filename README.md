#Fantasy Fighter

A top-down, turn-based, role-playing, fighting game created for Ludem Dare 41!

This game requires SFML to compile and play. On Ubuntu and Linux Mint, you can
install SFML using,
```
$ sudo apt install libsfml-dev
```
You can then compile the code with the command
```
$ g++ main.cpp -o application -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -lsfml-audio
```
Then running the application script will start the game.
The game hasn't yet been tested when not compiled from source.
